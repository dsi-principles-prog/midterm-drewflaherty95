NBA Individual Player Statistics 2014-2019
Source: Basketball-Reference

This data contains per game and advanced metrics for NBA players between the 2014-2015 and 2018-2019 seasons

I am interested in predicting how many points a player will average during a season
  Key indicators of scoring in the NBA are shooting percentage and position
    Different positions are placed at different parts of the court
    Some are closer to the basket than others and this will affect how often they make shots
    Some players take more 3 point shots than others, so this will also affect how may points they score
    3 point attempt rate tracks the proportion of 3 point shots a player takes to their total number of shots
    True shooting percentage encapsulates 2 point field goal percentage, 3 point field goal percentage, and free throw percentage
