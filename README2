NBA Individual Player Statistics 2014-2019
Source: Basketball-Reference

This data contains per game and advanced metrics for NBA players between the 2014-2015 and 2018-2019 seasons

I am interested in predicting how many points a player will average during a season
  Key indicators of scoring in the NBA are shooting percentage and position
    
   Position
    Different positions are placed at different parts of the court
    Some positionsare closer to the basket than others and this will affect how often they make shots
    Some players take more 3 point shots than others, so this will also affect how may points they score
    
  3 point attempt rate
    3 point attempt rate tracks the proportion of 3 point shots a player takes to their total number of shots
    
  True Shooting Percentage (TS%)
    True shooting percentage encapsulates 2 point field goal percentage, 3 point field goal percentage, and free throw percentage
    
  Conference 
    All teams in the NBA are in either the Western or Eastern Conference
    The quality of play in one conference is potentially higher in once conference than the other
    This could have an affect on the number of points scored by a player
    
  Average Shooting
    Players who shoot above the league average will likely score more than those who have worse shooting percentages
